# Year One API Project

Run `npm install` first, then create a database with `createdb year_one_project`

For development, first run `npm run start-server` and then  separately run `npm run start` in a different terminal.

React-scripts will load up a dev server on port 3000, but will send API calls to our API server at port 8000, via a proxy.
